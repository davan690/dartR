\title{Performs and AMOVA using genlight data.}
\usage{
gl.amova(x, permutations = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{-- name of the genlight containing the SNP genotypes, with population information [required]}

\item{permutations}{-- number of permuations to perform for hypothesis testing [default 100]. Please note should be set to 1000 for analysis.]}
}
\value{
An object of class "amova" which is a list with a table of sums of square deviations (SSD), mean square deviations (MSD), and the number of degrees of freedom, and a vector of variance components.
}
\description{
This script performs an AMOVA based on the genetic distance matrix from stamppNeisD() [package StAMPP] using the amova() function from the package PEGAS for exploring within and between population variation. For detailed information use their help pages: ?pegas::amova, ?StAMPP::stamppAmova
