\title{Filter loci in a genlight \{adegenet\} object based on counts of sequence tags scored at a locus (read depth)}
\usage{
gl.filter.rdepth(x, lower = 5, upper = 50, verbose = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{-- name of the genlight object containing the SNP data [required]}

\item{lower}{-- lower threshold value below which loci will be removed [default 5]}

\item{upper}{-- upper threshold value above which loci will be removed [default 50]}

\item{verbose}{-- verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2, progress log ; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report [default 2]}
}
\value{
Returns a genlight object retaining loci with a Read Depth in the range specified by the lower and upper threshold.
}
\description{
SNP datasets generated by DArT report AvgCountRef and AvgCountSnp as counts of sequence tags for the reference and alternate alleles respectively.
These can be added for an index of Read Depth. Filtering on Read Depth can be on the basis of loci with exceptionally low counts, or
loci with exceptionally high counts.
