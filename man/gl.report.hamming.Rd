\title{Calculates the pairwise Hamming distance between DArT trimmed DNA sequences}
\usage{
gl.report.hamming(x, rs = 5, plot = FALSE, smearplot = FALSE,
  probar = TRUE, verbose = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{-- name of the genlight object containing the SNP data [required]}

\item{rs}{-- number of bases in the restriction enzyme recognition sequence [default = 5]}

\item{plot}{specify if a histogram of Hamming distance is to be produced [default FALSE]}

\item{smearplot}{if TRUE, will produce a smearplot of individuals against loci [default FALSE]}

\item{probar}{-- if TRUE, then a progress bar is desplayed on long loops [default = TRUE]}

\item{verbose}{level of verbosity. verbose=0 is silent, verbose=1 returns more detailed output during conversion.}
}
\value{
Tabulation of loc that will be lost on filtering, against values of the threshold
}
\description{
Hamming distance is calculated as the number of base differences between two 
sequences which can be expressed as a count or a proportion. Typically, it is
calculated between two sequences of equal length. In the context of DArT
trimmed sequences, which differ in length but which are anchored to the left
by the restriction enzyme recognition sequence, it is sensible to compare the
two trimmed sequences starting from immediately after the common recognition
sequence and terminating at the last base of the shorter sequence.
}
\details{
Hamming distance can be computed 
by exploiting the fact that the dot product of two binary vectors x and (1-y)
counts the corresponding elements that are different between x and y.
This approach can also be used for vectors that contain more than two possible 
values at each position (e.g. A, C, T or G).

If a pair of DNA sequences are of differing length, the longer is truncated.

The algorithm is that of Johann de Jong 
\url{https://johanndejong.wordpress.com/2015/10/02/faster-hamming-distance-in-r-2/}
as implimented in utils.hamming.r

A histogram and or a smearplot can be requested. Note that the smearplot is computationally intensive, and will take time to 
execute on large datasets.
