\title{Collapse a fixed distance matrix by amalgamating populations for which pairwise fixed differences are not significant}
\usage{
gl.collapse.pval(fd, delta = 0.02, reps = 1000, alpha = 0.05,
  plot = FALSE, verbose = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{fd}{-- name of the list containing the collapsed gl object and associated distance matricies output by gl.collapse run with test=TRUE [required]}

\item{delta}{-- threshold for the level of difference between two populations that will be regarded as operationally fixed [Default 0.02]}

\item{reps}{number of repetitions in the simulations to estimate false positives. [Default 1000].}

\item{alpha}{-- significance level for test of false positives [default 0.05]}

\item{plot}{-- if TRUE, plot a PCoA with the new groupings [default FALSE]}

\item{verbose}{-- verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2, progress log ; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report [default 2]}
}
\value{
A list containing the gl object with the new collapsed populations and the following square matricies
        [[1]] $gl -- the input genlight object;
        [[2]] $fd -- raw fixed differences;
        [[3]] $pcfd -- percent fixed differences;
        [[4]] $nobs -- mean no. of individuals used in each comparison;
        [[5]] $nloc -- total number of loci used in each comparison;
        [[6]] $expobs -- the expected count of false positives for each comparison [by simulation], otherwise NAs
        [[7]] $prob -- the significance of the count of fixed differences [by simulation]. These should all be significant (< alpha)
}
\description{
This script takes the output from gl.collapse and further collapses the fixed difference matrix
based on the pvalue associated with each comparison. The results are subsets of populations (OTUs) for which
diagnosability is demonstrated in the sample set, but non-significant.
