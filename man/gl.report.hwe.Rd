\title{Reports departure from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium}
\usage{
gl.report.hwe(x, subset = "each", plot = FALSE, method = "ChiSquare",
  alpha = 0.05, bonf = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{-- a genlight object containing the SNP genotypes [Required]}

\item{subset}{-- either, list populations to combine in the analysis | each | all [Default "each"]}

\item{plot}{-- if TRUE,  will produce a Ternary Plot(s) [default FALSE]}

\item{method}{-- for determining the statistical signicance in the ternary plot: ChiSquare (with continuity correction) | Fisher [default "ChiSquare"]}

\item{alpha}{-- level of significance for testing [default 0.05]}

\item{bonf}{-- if TRUE, Bonferroni correction will be applied to the level of significance [default TRUE]}
}
\value{
a dataframe containing loci, counts of reference SNP homozygotes, heterozygotes
and alternate SNP homozygotes; probability of departure from H-W equilibrium,
and per locus significance with and without Bonferroni Correction.
}
\description{
Calculates the probabilities of agreement with H-W equilibrium based on observed
frequencies of reference homozygotes, heterozygotes and alternate homozygotes. 
Uses the exact calculations contained in function prob.hwe() as developed by Wigginton et al. (2005).
}
\details{
Tests are applied to each locus across all populations pooled (subset="all"), to each locus considered within each population treated separately
(subset="each") or to each locus within selected populations pooled (subset=c("pop1","pop2")). Tests for HWE are
only valid if there is no population substructure (assuming random mating), and the tests have sufficient power
only when there is sufficient sample size (say, n individuals > 20). Note also that correction for multiple comparisons is probably required
if you wish to place particular importance on one or a few significant departures.

A Ternary Plot is optionally produced -- see Graffelman et al.(2008) for further details. Implementation of the Ternary Plot is via package {HardyWeinberg} 
(Graffelman (2015). The plot labels loci that depart significantly from HWE as red, and those not showing significant departure as green. 
Two methods are used to determine significance. ChiSquare (with correction) is traditional but involves approximations; Fisher is computationally 
more expensive, but applies a Fisher Exact Test of departure from HWE.
