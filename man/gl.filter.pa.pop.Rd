\title{Filter loci that contain private (and fixed alleles) between two populations.}
\usage{
gl.filter.pa.pop(x, pop1, pop2, invers = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{-- name of the genlight object containing the SNP data [required]}

\item{pop1}{-- name of the first parental population (in quotes)}

\item{pop2}{-- name of the second parental population (in quotes)}

\item{invers}{-- switch to filter for all loci that have no private alleles and are not fixed}
}
\value{
The reduced genlight dataset, containing now only fixed and private alleles
}
\description{
This script is meant to be used prior to \code{gl.nhybrids} to maximise the information content of the snps used to identify hybrids (currently newhybrids does allow only 200 SNPs). The idea is to use first all loci that have fixed alleles between the potential source populations and then "fill up" to 200 loci using loci that have private alleles between those. The functions filters for those loci (if invers is set to TRUE, the opposite is returned (all loci that are not fixed and have no private alleles - not sure why yet, but maybe useful.)
