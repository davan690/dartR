\title{Write out data from a gl object \link{adegenet} to csv file}
\usage{
gl.write.csv(x, outfile = "outfile.csv", outpath = tempdir(),
  verbose = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{-- name of the genlight object containing the SNP data [required]}

\item{outfile}{-- file name of the output file (including extension) [default outfile.csv]}

\item{outpath}{-- path where to save the output file [default tempdir(), mandated by CRAN]. Use outpath=getwd() or outpath="." when calling this function to direct output files to your working directory.}

\item{verbose}{-- specify the level of verbosity: 0, silent, fatal errors only; 1, flag function begin and end; 2, progress log ; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report [default 2]}
}
\value{
saves a glenlight object to csv, returns NULL
}
\description{
This script writes to file the SNP genotypes with specimens as entities (columns) and
loci as attributes (rows). Each row has associated locus metadata. Each column, with header
of specimen id, has population in the first row.
}
\details{
The data coding differs from the DArT 1row format in that 0 = reference homozygous, 2 =
alternate homozygous, 1 = heterozyous, and NA = missing SNP assignment.
